## Website To Replicate
[apple.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20231017232700/https://www.apple.com/)

## Getting Started
- ⚠️ Website errors ⚠️
- Search and hamburger buttons work on second click

- Chrome:
- In Chromium browsers it works almost fine.

- Firefox and edge:
- In these browsers, for the animation to be seen correctly, it is necessary to have the monitor resolution at 1920p x 1080p.
- As with chromium, the animation also fails if you scroll too fast and the browser's zoom also has to be by default (100%).
- Local storage in these browsers does not work correctly.

1. download and have the index.html
